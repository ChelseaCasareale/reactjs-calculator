# React Calculator

I previously made a JavaScript calculator with JQuery on Codepen and decided to make a React powered version. It is deployed on Heroku (link above in the description).

To do:
- Fix any little bugs I find
- Testing. Mostly I just need to figure out testing with React
- Maybe add Redux
